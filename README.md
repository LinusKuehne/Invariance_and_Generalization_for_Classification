# Invariance and Generalization for Classification
 This repo contains the code associated with the master's thesis "Invariance and Generalization for Classification" written by Linus KÃ¼hne at the Seminar for Statistics, Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, in 2024. The thesis was supervised by Prof. Jonas Peters and co-supervised by Sorawit (James) Saengkyongam. 

 ## Content of the repository
 This repo contains all code used to create parts of the thesis. It also contains pre-processed data from the pyrocast database presented in (Tazi et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13052v1)). The preprocessing is explained in the thesis and in (Salas-Porras et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08883v3)). I have explicit permission by Kenza Tazi to publish these files here.
